Marathon Planner v0.4

**************************************************************************
SUMMARY
**************************************************************************
Running a marathon can be a very challenging endeavor. Once you have actually convinced yourself that you’re willing to put your body through 26.2 miles of running, the next step is to set a goal and figure out an effective training plan. You don’t want to overtrain because you may hit a wall early and you don’t want to undertrain because you don’t want to endure 4+ hours of pain. People spend hundreds of dollars and countless hours researching the “perfect” training plan that will help them attain a desired run time goal. This is where we step in. Our solution uses statistical analysis of data from previous marathon runners to create an effective train up plan for your average runner. In a matter of seconds and with minimal personal data, our model will provide a runner with a customized train-up plan to help take him or her across that marathon finish​ line.
With such a quick and effective tool, we hope to gain a large amount of the marathon runner market share and increase our positioning in the fitness industry.
